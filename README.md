I tried several different ways to render the HTML output correctly, but the following seemed to be the only way I could get it to work.

To view HTML in GitHub repository correctly:
1. In a browser, go to: https://htmlpreview.github.io/
2. Enter the URL "https://github.com/derekwhipple/PracticalMachineLearning/blob/gh-pages/FitActivity.html" in the text box.
